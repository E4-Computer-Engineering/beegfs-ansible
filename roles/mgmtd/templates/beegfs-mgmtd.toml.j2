# BeeGFS management service configuration file

# This file configures the BeeGFS management node and can be used as an alternative or together with
# command line arguments. Command line arguments overwrite arguments specified here,
# arguments specified here overwrite the internal defaults.
#
# The command line help might have more information on a specific setting. Run the management
# binary with `--help` to display it.

### General ###

# Disables registration of new nodes and targets (clients excluded).

# Defines after which time without contact a node/target is considered offline.
# IMPORTANT: This setting must be the same on all nodes in the system, especially when using
# mirroring.

# Maximum number of blocking worker threads.
# These are started on demand and kept running for some time in idle state before being dropped
# again. Currently, they are only used for parallel database operations. Each thread uses its own
# sqlite connection, meaning an extra open file. Therefore, this settings also limits the maximum
# number of open sqlite files of the process. This setting only affects systems with high read
# operation load and should usually be left alone.

### Quota ###

# Enables quota data collection and checks.

# the IDs that exceed the limits and reports them back to the server nodes.

# The following options specify the User/Group IDs to be fetched from storage services for quota
# checking and enforcement. They are disabled by default and least one needs to be enabled for
# quota enforcement having any effect. They can be mixed.

# Defines the minimum id of the existing system users to be quota checked and enforced.
# Note that this uses the users from the local machine the management is running on.
