# command line arguments. Command line arguments overwrite arguments specified here,
# arguments specified here overwrite the internal defaults.

# The command line help might have more information on a specific setting. Run the management
# binary with `--help` to display it.

# Maximum number of blocking worker threads.
# These are started on demand and kept running for some time in idle state before being dropped
# again. Currently, they are only used for parallel database operations. Each thread uses its own

# checking and enforcement. They are disabled by default and least one needs to be enabled for
